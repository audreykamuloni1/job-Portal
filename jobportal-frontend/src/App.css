/* App.css - Minimize global styles to rely on MUI and CssBaseline */

/* You can add very specific global overrides here if absolutely necessary, */
/* but prefer using MUI's theming and sx prop or styled components. */

/* Example:
body {
  // Example: A global scrollbar style if you want something custom
  // Note: CssBaseline already provides a good base.
}
*/

/* The .App class and .main-content class from previous versions are removed */
/* as MainLayout.js now handles the primary layout structure. */
/* Custom button styles (.btn-primary, etc.) are also removed as MUI Buttons will be used. */
/* Loading spinner styles are removed; MUI has <CircularProgress />. */

/* Keep this file minimal. */
